Use Alfred search to get information about your Animal Crossing villagers, and hit `enter` to get even more information from the Animal Crossing wiki.

How to use
----------

To invoke **alfred-animal-crossing**, simply type `ac` followed by the villager you would like more information about. The workflow will then display a list of all the available information for that villager, which you can then action by pressing `enter` to get taken to the Animal Crossing wiki for even more detail.

**alfred-animal-crossing** also allows you to filter by each piece of information per villager. If you enter `ac alfonso s`, **alfred-animal-crossing** will return `species, star sign, skill, style, favorite song`. You can filter for any piece of information. The available filters are:

-	`gender`
-	`personality`
-	`species`
-	`birthday`
-	`sign` (Star sign)
-	`phrase` (Initial phrase)
-	`clothes` (Initial clothes)
-	`skill`
-	`goal`
-	`coffee`
-	`style`
-	`song` (Favorite song)
-	`appearances`
-	`names` (Regional names)

As you can see, some filters have shortened names (e.g. Star sign â†’ sign) to reduce typing. You can even press `tab` to autocomplete entries as you type. Some villagers from older games may not have all the information available, so only the relevant results will be returned.
